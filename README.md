# TicTacToeApplicationClient
This was a project to learn about / make my own server

This is the client side of my TicTacToeApplication. The server side can be found at https://github.com/Connor-Brown/TicTacToeApplicationServer

The Application is all about playing Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe either between an AI or another player between client and server.

Rules for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe
